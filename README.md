# Project Title
## About the Project
### Goals
- Build a dataset of job postings with the field of data science, analytics, etc.
- Create labels for each job posting; for example, data scientist, data engineer, etc.
- Develop a machine learning model to classify a job based on description text
- Identify the most common words and phrases for each label

### Background

>As a Data Scientist seeking a job in-field, I thought it would be fun and useful to practice my skills using >NLP to classify jobs based on the posting descriptions from popular sites like LinkedIn. 
>
>Many candidates starting their search may have their resume's sidestepped by recruiters or a company's ATS system. I want to build a list of common words and phrases that each job title uses to hopefully increase candidate's chances by tailoring their individual skills/experience to match the job closer.

### Deliverables
- A script that runs the classification model
- A CSV of the most common words and phrases for each job title
